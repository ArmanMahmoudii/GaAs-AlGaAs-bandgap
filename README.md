# GaAs-AlGaAs-bandgap
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook-based interactive web app that visualizes the band gap structure of GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Users can dynamically configure layer materials, thicknesses, and quantum well parameters (e.g., temperature and Al fraction) to explore the energy levels in the conduction and valence bands.
